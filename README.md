This package implements the fast multiple scattering code described in [1].

This code requires TMATROM (https://github.com/stuart-hawkins/tmatrom).

To install the code, download the files to folder fast-multiple-scattering and then

  cd('[your-path]/fast-multiple-scattering')
  setpath_fast_multiple_scattering.

For a description of the package contents enter

  help fast-multiple-scattering

in the Matlab command window.
